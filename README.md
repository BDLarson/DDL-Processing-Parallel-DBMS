# DDL-Processing-Parallel-DBMS

# implementation of the DDL processing component of a parallel SQL processing system. The parallel SQL processing system      # consists of a cluster of DBMS instances running on different machines (possibly virtual machines). DDLs submitted to the     # system will need to be translated into corresponding DDLs for each individual DBMS instance in the cluster and executed     # there. In addition a catalog database stores metadata about what data is stored for each table on each DBMS instance in the # cluster.

# sudo apt install python3
# sudo apt install sqlite3
